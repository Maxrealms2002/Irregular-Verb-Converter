# Irregular-Verb-Converter
This is one of my first projects ever made. This app helps people learn irregular verbs.

## What is it?

This app was developed to help people study and revise some common irregular verbs in the English language based on a list carefully chosen.
In addition, this app also offers the possibility to play an interactive game where users will choose the correct answer among the possible options according to the example sentences displayed on screen. There are 10 exercises, so the objective of the game is to reach the top score.
Users can also look up specific verbs to see some examples and their meanings.

## How does it work?
